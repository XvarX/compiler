A tumultuous weather system driving deadly tornadoes and flash flooding that killed at least 43 people continued its violent march across the Midwest and South on Monday, snarling traffic, grounding hundreds of flights and wreaking havoc for holiday travelers.

Hundreds of thousands of people lost power Monday — including more than 120,000 in Oklahoma, where Gov. Mary Fallin extended a state of emergency on Monday that was originally called for on Nov. 29.

In Mascoutah, Ill., a school bus with 15 to 20 children on board and a tractor trailor slipped into a retention pond. Emergency responders rescued the driver and the children and all were reported safe, according to Fox 2 Now and Rob Edwards, reporter at KSDK.

The National Weather Service forecast heavy snow and dangerous ice storms for the Upper Midwest late Monday and into early Tuesday. Iowa, Minnesota, Wisconsin and Michigan were all bracing for the worst of the ice and snow.

Also on Tuesday, sections of the Northeast and New England will be white for the first time this season — up to eight inches of snow were forecast for Portland, Maine.

Some good news for Tuesday: There are no severe thunderstorms (the storms that produce tornadoes) forecast for anywhere in the nation on Tuesday, according to the Storm Prediction Center.

In West Texas, Vito Randazzo said he idled on an iced-over I-10 for about 13 hours before driving across a median Monday to escape the backup on a service road.

“Everybody’s just sleeping in their cars,” Randazzo told the Associated Press. “I can’t believe the road was left in this condition.”

The news wasn't good for fliers, either. Almost 1,165 flights had been canceled nationwide and another 1,900 plus were delayed as of 1 p.m. ET on Monday. Chicago and Dallas were especially hard hit. On Sunday, more than 1,600 flights were canceled and 6,300 delayed.

The precarious weather followed a string of wicked tornadoes and storms that roared through the Dallas area on Saturday, killing 11 people. Hardest hit was Garland, a city of 230,000 people 20 miles northeast of Dallas, where eight people died and 15 were injured, police Lt. Pedro Barineau said. He said the storms damaged 600 homes and businesses.

One of the nine confirmed tornadoes that roared through Texas reached as high as an EF-4 classification, with winds reaching 175 mph, the weather service said.

In the Midwest, at least eight people died in Missouri flooding, and Gov. Jay Nixon declared a state of emergency as heavy rains and flash floods paralyzed much of the state. Floods closed more than 200 roads, the state Department of Transportation reported.

“Multiple fatalities due to flash flooding have already been reported, and I urge Missourians in flood-affected areas to stay alert, avoid travel if possible and never drive into a flooded roadway," Nixon said.

Hundreds of river gauges were at flood stage in the central U.S., the weather service reported.

2015 is now the wettest year on record in St. Louis, according to the weather service. There was 58.6 inches of precipitation as of early Monday.

River flooding will be a big issue later this week, as a massive pulse of floodwaters from this weekend's epic rain will pile into the Mississippi River over the next few days, bringing the river to flood levels never recorded this time of year, according to Weather Underground meteorologist Jeff Masters.

In Missouri, all-time record flood levels could be set in Chester and Cape Girardeau by week's end, Masters said.

Snow and ice brought whiteout conditions in New Mexico, where Gov. Susana Martinez declared a state of emergency due to the "dire situation." Roswell, N.M., picked up 12.4 inches of snow on Sunday, its snowiest day ever recorded, the weather service said.

In Oklahoma, an eight-mile stretch of U.S. 81 west of Norman was closed due to downed power lines. Numerous road closures were reported as the state struggled with heavy rains and flooding in some areas and ice and snow in others.

"Slick conditions developing, salt & sand trucks are out," the state Transportation Department tweeted. "Use caution if traveling this morning, especially on bridges."

Weather service meteorologist Mark Wiley said parts of Texas, Oklahoma and New Mexico could expect 8 to16 inches of snow. Some isolated areas could see 20 inches or more before the storm slides east sometime Monday.

In addition to the fatalities in Missouri and Texas, at least five people died in Illinois. And flooding in the Southeast last week killed 19.
